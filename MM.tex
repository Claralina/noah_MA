\chapter{Methods and Implementation}
  \label{Methods}
In the following pages I will to describe the linkage algorithm that has been implemented.
I will start by describing \ac{CECILIA}, with which the \ac{PPRL} algorithm has been implemented.
Then, detailed descriptions of the various program parts and methods will be given.
Since \ac{SMPC}'s main struggle is runtime, performance considerations will be detailed in a separate section.
Lastly, I will describe the generation of synthetic data with which the algorithm has been tested.
